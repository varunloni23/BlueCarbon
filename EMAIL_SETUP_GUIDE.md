## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

### Option A: Create .env file (Recommended for Development)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/razashaikh/Desktop/sih/backend
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

4. Update these lines with your credentials:
   ```env
   SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   SENDER_APP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
   ```

5. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

### Option B: Export Environment Variables (Quick Test)

```bash
export SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
export SENDER_APP_PASSWORD="abcdefghijklmnop"
```

## üß™ Step 4: Test Email Configuration

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/razashaikh/Desktop/sih/backend
   python production_server.py
   ```

2. You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Email service configured: your-email@gmail.com
   ```

3. Test sending OTP via API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/auth/send-otp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "purpose": "registration"
     }'
   ```

4. Check the test email inbox - you should receive the OTP!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error: "Username and Password not accepted"

**Solution:** Double-check your app password:
- Make sure you copied all 16 characters
- Remove any spaces from the password
- Ensure 2FA is enabled on your Google account

### Error: "SMTP Authentication Error"

**Solution:** 
- Verify `SENDER_EMAIL` matches the Gmail account that generated the app password
- Try generating a new app password
- Check if "Less secure app access" is disabled (it should be with app passwords)

### Error: "Connection timed out"

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify firewall isn't blocking port 587
- Try changing `SMTP_PORT` to 465 and use SSL instead of TLS

### Emails not received

**Solution:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify the recipient email is correct
- Check Gmail "Sent" folder to confirm email was sent
- Try sending to a different email provider

## üìù Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit .env file to Git** - It's already in .gitignore
2. **Keep your app password secret** - Treat it like a regular password
3. **Revoke app passwords** you're not using from Google Account settings
4. **Use environment variables** in production, not .env files

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production (Render, Heroku, etc.):

1. Add environment variables in the hosting platform dashboard:
   - `SENDER_EMAIL`
   - `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD`
   - `SMTP_SERVER` (optional, defaults to smtp.gmail.com)
   - `SMTP_PORT` (optional, defaults to 587)

2. **DO NOT** deploy .env file to production

---

## üìß Email Templates

The system sends these types of emails:

1. **OTP for Registration** - 6-digit code to verify email
2. **OTP for Password Reset** - 6-digit code to reset password
3. **Welcome Email** - Sent after successful registration
4. **Password Reset Confirmation** - Sent after password change
5. **Project Status Notification** - Sent when project is approved/rejected

All emails are styled with HTML templates for professional appearance.
